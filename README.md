Applied Introduction to Econometrics with Stata - Notes

The relevant files are a good start for those who take the Introduction to Econometrics course and want to practice it. However, do not forget that STATA is a paid program. Please keep in mind that Time Series Analysis and Panel Data will be introduced in the continuation of these topics, and theoretical readings should be made before moving on to these topics.

Relevant notes were prepared by Yasin Tosun from Siegen University between September 2022 and March 2023 for the course contents of the ECONMATIC brand, which is within the scope of the internal training program of the Gen√ß Ekonomistler Club.

For the use of relevant notes and full version notes, you are kindly requested to contact the course instructors.

Thanks!
